# 2015_Axial_Seamount_Eruption_Temp_Data
#In 2015, the Axial Seamount volcano erupted off the coast of Oregon. This event was extensively recorded 
#by the Ocean Observatory Initiative (OOI). 

#Using data downloaded in .csv format from the OOI with a bottom pressure and tilt sensor (BOTPT) located 
#in the proximity of the volcano:

#Eastern Caldera:
#https://ooinet.oceanobservatories.org/data_access/?search=RS03ECAL-MJ03E-06-BOTPTA302

#Central Caldera:
#https://ooinet.oceanobservatories.org/data_access/?search=RS03CCAL-MJ03F-05-BOTPTA301

#International District:
#https://ooinet.oceanobservatories.org/data_access/?search=RS03INT2-MJ03D-06-BOTPTA303

#Plots of temperature, pressure, tilt (degrees), tilt(magnitude) and more can be plotted. An account will need to be created with OOI to 
#have access to the data. The small code sample shows how to plot the temperature from the Eastern Caldera (after downloaded).
